# minigrep

minigrep is a simple IO tutorial project from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition) and I improved it with iteration feature for practising rust.

pipelining is not supported yet.

## Usage

```bash
minigrep <query> <filename>
# for case-insensitive search
CASE_INSENSITIVE=1 minigrep <query> <filename>
```
